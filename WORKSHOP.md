## Step 1: Clone and Open in Cursor

### 1.1 Open Terminal

- **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **Windows:** Press `Win + R`, type "cmd", press Enter

### 1.2 Clone the Code

Copy and paste this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itayshmool/simon-game-app-cday.git
```

### 1.3 Open in Cursor

1. Open **Cursor IDE**
2. Click **File** → **Open Folder**
3. Navigate to the `simon-game-app-cday` folder
4. Click **Open**

---

## Step 2: Setup and Run

---

## Step 3: Test the Game Locally

1. Click **"Create Game"**
2. Enter your name, pick an avatar
3. Click **"Create Game"**
4. Copy the **game code** (e.g., `ABC123`)
5. Open a **new browser tab**
6. Go to **http://localhost:5173**
7. Click **"Join Game"**
8. Paste the game code, enter a different name
9. Go back to first tab → Click **"Start Game"**
10. Play! 🎮

## Step 4: Deploy to Render

Now let's put your game online so anyone can play!

### 4.1 Create Your Own GitHub Repository

First, you need the code in YOUR GitHub account (not the workshop account).

**Run this command:**

```bash
npm run publish
```

This will:
1. ✅ Create a new repository in your GitHub account
2. ✅ Push all the code to it

When done, you'll see your repository URL: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simon-game-app`

> ⚠️ **First time?** If you see "GitHub CLI not installed", ask Cursor: "Help me install GitHub CLI and login"

---

### 4.2 Deploy on Render (Using Cursor)

**In Cursor chat (Cmd+L or Ctrl+L), ask:**

> "Deploy my simon-game-app to Render. Create a backend web service and a frontend static site using the render.yaml configuration"

Cursor will:
1. ✅ Create the backend service on Render
2. ✅ Create the frontend static site on Render
3. ✅ Configure the build commands
4. ✅ Give you the URLs when done

⏳ **Wait 5-10 minutes** for the first deployment to complete.

---

### 4.2 Alternative: Deploy Manually

If Cursor can't deploy, do it manually:

1. Go to [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click **New** → **Blueprint**
3. Connect your GitHub account (if prompted)
4. Select your `simon-game-app` repository
5. Click **Apply**

---

### 4.3 Get Your URLs

Once deployed (green checkmarks), find your URLs:

| Service | Where to find URL |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Backend** | Click `simon-game-backend` → URL at top |
| **Frontend** | Click `simon-game-frontend` → URL at top |

📝 **Copy both URLs!**

---

### 4.4 Configure Environment Variables

#### Backend Service:
1. Click **simon-game-backend** → **Environment** (left sidebar)
2. Set `FRONTEND_URL` = your frontend URL
3. Click **Save Changes**

#### Frontend Service:
1. Click **simon-game-frontend** → **Environment** (left sidebar)
2. Set `VITE_API_URL` = your backend URL
3. Set `VITE_SOCKET_URL` = your backend URL
4. Click **Save Changes**

⏳ Wait for redeploy (green checkmark).

---

### 4.5 Test Online

1. Open your **frontend URL** in browser
2. Create a game
3. Share the link with a friend
4. Play together! 🎉

---

## 🎉 Congratulations!

You've successfully:
- ✅ Set up a full-stack TypeScript project
- ✅ Run a React + WebSocket app locally
- ✅ Deployed to the cloud

**Your game is live!** Share the link with friends and family.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `npm run go` fails | Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version` should show v18+ |
| App won't start | Close other terminals, try again |
| Can't connect on Render | Check environment variables are set correctly |
| WebSocket issues | Make sure URLs use `https://` not `http://` |
